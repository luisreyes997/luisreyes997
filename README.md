# About me 👋😁

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: a modular BI portfolio with clean visualizations and reporting, optimized for GitHub and Excel export. It’s part of a sprint to showcase my analytics toolkit and strategic thinking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: how to refine my Python workflows for business intelligence—especially pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn—to build scalable, monetizable dashboards.
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn or GitHub
- 🧩 Philosophy meets anime: I love exploring deep questions about time, identity, and meaning—especially when they show up in anime or spiritual traditions.
